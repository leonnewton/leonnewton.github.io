However, due to the increasing complexity of CPSs and more sophisticated attacks, conventional anomaly detection methods cannot be directly applied to thwart such issues, which also need domain-specific knowledge and handle the growing volume of data. Deep learning-based anomaly detection (DLAD) methods have been proposed to achieve unsupervised detection in the era of CPS big data. In this paper, we review state-of-the-art DLAD methods in CPSs. We propose a taxonomy in terms of the type of anomalies, strategies, implementation and evaluation metrics to understand the essential properties of current methods. Further, we utilize this taxonomy to identify and highlight new characteristics and designs in each CPS domain. We summarise a list of publicly available datasets for training and evaluation. We also discuss our findings, the limitations of existing studies, and possible directions to improve DLAD methods.","tags":[],"title":"Deep Learning-Based Anomaly Detection in Cyber-Physical Systems: Progress and Opportunities","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yuan Luo","Long Cheng","Hongxin Hu","Guojun Peng","Danfeng Yao"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1599190004,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1599190004,"objectID":"cae16f2c89f4d858403ea22edd78c1ef","permalink":"https://leonnewton.github.io/publication/ieeeiot/","publishdate":"2020-09-04T11:26:44+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/ieeeiot/","section":"publication","summary":"Emerging Internet of Things (IoT) systems leverage connected devices to enable intelligent and automated functionalities. Despite the benefits, there exist privacy risks of network traffic, which have been studied by the previous research. However, with the current privacy inference remaining at the event-level, potential privacy risks are underestimated, which, as our study shows, can be much higher than previously reported through app-level traffic analysis. A key observation of our research is that IoT event-triggered traffic is generated by apps, which often adopt an if-trigger-then-action (triggeraction) programming paradigm. We utilize this feature to develop fingerprints to differentiate running apps, and learn contextrich privacy-sensitive information from apps. In this paper, we present a privacy leakage analysis called ALTA to infer running apps in smart home IoT environments. First, ALTA identifies app fingerprints through static analysis, and extracts sensitive information from app descriptions and input prompts. Then, through dynamic traffic profiling, it learns traffic fingerprints of apps. Finally, ALTA matches the fingerprints of app and traffic, and thus is able to pinpoint which app is running from IoT traffic at runtime. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we analyze 254 SmartThings applications via program and natural language processing (NLP) analysis. We also perform the app inference evaluation on 31 apps executed in a simulated smart home. The results suggest that ALTA can effectively infer running apps from IoT traffic and learn context-rich information (e.g., health conditions, daily routines, and user activities) from apps with high accuracy.","tags":[],"title":"Context-rich Privacy Leakage Analysis through Inferring Apps in Smart Home IoT","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"6fcef2921fbc4727907ce9ef89c022a0","permalink":"https://leonnewton.github.io/newsection/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/newsection/","section":"","summary":"Hello!","tags":null,"title":"Contact","type":"widget_page"}]
